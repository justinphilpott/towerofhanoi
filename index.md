# towerofhanoi.app documentation
## Discussing simple game development with React and XState, state and process modelling theory and model based testing with XState/test.

---

I initially created [towerofhanoi.app](){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} to learn the state management library [XState](https://xstate.js.org/docs/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} (which utilises [finite state machines](https://brilliant.org/wiki/finite-state-machines/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}), and it ended up becoming a web app build on [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}, [Chakra UI](), XState/react and XState/test.

For those not familiar with the game, have a read about [the original puzzle](/the-puzzle.html). You can also play it here [Tower of Hanoi app](){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} if you haven't already!

Check out the overview of development and my thoughts on modelling state that flow from that.
