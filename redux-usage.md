# State modelling and XState

### Intro

So, how do we go about modelling the various states that a system can occupy? In the case of this game, I spent a good amount of time playing it on paper and in my head (a good challenge actually!), understanding it, and how to solve it. In fact I went way deeper into the permutative

One of the first important distinctions that made itself clear to me as I was scribbling flow charts  is to
